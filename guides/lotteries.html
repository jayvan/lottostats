        <h4><strong>Which Lottery Should I Pick?</strong></h4>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>There’s no single lottery that is perfect for everybody, but fortunately OLG has a wide variety of lotteries.
There’s guaranteed to be something that matches your play style!
Do you like the thrill of a huge 60 million dollar jackpot?
Or maybe you’re just as happy with $100,000 and you’ll take the better odds.
Whatever your play style is, read on to find the best lottery for you.
Starting with the liveliest, here are the play styles…</p>

<h3 id="the-dreamer---high-risk---big-jackpots"><strong>The Dreamer - High Risk - Big Jackpots</strong></h3>
<p>Dreamers start to envision mansions, yachts, and exotic getaways when they see that the Lotto MAX Jackpot is at 60 million dollars.
No prize matters but the jackpot, and that jackpot is going to be yours!
Many enjoy the thrill of extremely large jackpots, but they are called jackpots for a reason, they are extremely difficult to win.
Even on weeks where 16 million tickets are purchased for Lotto MAX it’s not uncommon for the jackpot to go unclaimed, growing week after week.
Chasing big jackpots yields a huge reward, but be warned: they are extremely difficult to win.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for big jackpots you’ll want to keep your eye on <a href="/national/lotto_max.html">Lotto MAX</a>, <a href="/national/649.html">Lotto 649</a>, and possibly <a href="/ontario/49.html">Ontario 49</a>.
These 3 lotteries tend to have the largest jackpots each week.
You’ll want to avoid the instant games, at just $100,000 they aren’t going to be buying you a private jet.</p>

<h3 id="long-term---medium-risk---best-return"><strong>Long Term - Medium Risk - Best Return</strong></h3>
<p>Long term players know that it isn’t just about the jackpot, it’s about the smaller prizes too.
Playing weekly, you are way more likely to only match a few numbers than you are to match them all and win the jackpot.
Since you’re way more likely to miss a number or two than to win the jackpot, the prizes for coming close actually matter much more than the jackpot.
A lotteries expected return tells you how much money you will win back on average.
For example if the average return for a lottery is $2.50, and tickets cost $5, then that means that for every $5 ticket you buy, you will win back $2.50 on average.
This doesn’t mean you will win back $2.50 every time you play though, sometimes you won’t win anything, sometimes you’ll win more than $5.
Overall over the course of hundreds of tickets you will get back $2.50 per play.
Since different games have different costs per ticket, it’s common to express the return as a percentage of the ticket cost.
This is called return on investment or ROI.
For example if a ticket costs $2 and the expected return is $1, the return on investment is 50%.
If a ticket cost $4 and the expected return was $1, the return on investment would be 25%.</p>

<p>This is the most economical way to determine which lottery to play if you play often and want to win as much as possible while keeping your spending down.
In general the lotteries with the best returns are the instant games.
The instant games give you an instant chance to win a prize in addition to the nightly lottery draw.
The instant prizes are very generous, so the overall expected return ranges from 58.36% to 59.92%.
Compared to Lottario which tends to sit below 40%, you can see you’re winning much more on average.
So if expected return is your play style, check out <a href="/ontario/megadice.html">Megadice</a>, <a href="/ontario/poker-lotto.html">Poker Lotto</a>, and <a href="/ontario/wheel-of-fortune.html">Wheel of Fortune</a>.
A word of warning for Poker Lotto: you have the option of going “All-In”. Going “All-In” removes all the small prizes and it actually has the worst return in Ontario, so don’t go all in!</p>

<h2 id="the-prize-winner---low-risk---best-chance-of-a-prize"><strong>The Prize Winner - Low Risk - Best Chance of a Prize</strong></h2>
<p>Prize winners don’t care if they win $5, or $20, they just want to win something!
If you’re on a losing streak and just want a win, or you just hate to walk away empty handed this strategy is for you!
Each prize in a lottery has a chance of you winning it, the smaller prizes are easier to win while the bigger prizes are harder to win.
If you take the odds of each prize and add them all together, you get the total chance of winning a prize.
Most traditional lotteries sit at around a 15% chance of winning a prize.
This is because the jackpots are large, and in order for there to be enough prize money to fund them, most people need to win nothing.
Those same instant games that OLG runs are also the best for winning prizes.
This is because you have 2 chances to win in these games, once right away, and again in the nightly draw.
They range from a 26% chance of a prize up to 37.6%, more than double the odds of winning a prize in normal lotteries like Lotto 649 or Lotto Max.
So if going for the best chance of a prize is your play style, check out <a href="/ontario/wheel-of-fortune.html">Wheel of Fortune (37.63%)</a>.</p>
